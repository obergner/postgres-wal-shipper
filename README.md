# Postgresql WAL Shipper

## Installation

Eventually, after ```lein uberjar``` had it's say, this application will be packaged as a Docker container.
```make``` is your friend here:

```
```

## Usage

Start this application as a Docker container:

```
```

## Options

Postgresql WAL Shipper aspires to be a well-behaved 12-factor app and is therefore configured via environment variables.

## Customized REPL

This project uses the rather excellent [mount](https://github.com/tolitius/mount) library for clean and powerful state
management. It is therefore possible to start and stop this application - while disposing cleanly of any resources if need be - in the REPL. Commands for this have been added in namespace [user](./profiles/dev/src/user.clj), along with some other convenient helper functions:

```
